    <!-- 
        When I was a child, I would go to California for the summer to spend time with my family.
        
        I would spend most of my time with my younger cousin and her parents. Her parents are chiropractors. 
        
        I was spending the day with them at their office when a patient came in. 
       
        The patient had the first iphone. My cousin was excited because everytime this specific patient came in, she'd let her play on her iphone. 
        
        The lady let my cousin and I play “plant vs zombies” while she was at her appointment. this was my first experience interacting with a smartphone.
